 <p>Cheeseburgers are fun but why limit yourself to just a basic cheese burger?<br>Spice it up and have some fun with it! <br>That's what this recipe is all about, bringing a fun spin to the classic cheese burger.</p>
 <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Tbsp of Salted Butter (room temperature)</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup of BLue Cheese Crumbles</li>
        <li>1 1/2lbs of Ground Beef (or Turkey)</li>
        <li>2 Cups of Fresh Arugula</li>
        <li>4 Hamburger Buns</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Black Pepper</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Paprika</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Onion Powder</li>
        <li>2 Tsp Dried Rosemary</li>
        <li>2 Tsp Dried Thyme</li>
    </ul>
<h3>Directions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab a small bowl and mix the butter with the blue cheese. Blend with a fork. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine all the seasonings together in another bowl until you get a nice blend going. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Once those first two steps are done, mix them with your ground beef. You'll want to form four patties from this mix.</li>
        <li>Cover your four patties with plastic and place them in the fridge to set for an hour.</li>
        <li>Preheat your grill*, then add the patties, with some salt and pepper if you'd like.</li>
        <li>Grill each side for about 4-5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Use a meat thermometer and then let the patties sit for a few minutes if the temperature is accurate.</li>
        <li>You can now serve your patties! Don't forget to top them off with arugula. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
